### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, Enes MenekÅŸe
#### I'm Frontend Developer
I am currently a second-year student at Istanbul Commerce University. I have a B2 level
proficiency in English, enabling me to comfortably read articles and communicate effectively.
Throughout my university life, I have worked on projects in various programming languages
and aspire to see myself as a Front-end Developer in the future. I have a strong command of
HTML and CSS and am continuously improving myself in Javascript, engaging in ongoing
projects. Additionally, although I am relatively new to it, I am actively working on acquiring a
new skill set in ReactJs.


Skills: REACT / JS / HTML / CSS / JAVA / C
